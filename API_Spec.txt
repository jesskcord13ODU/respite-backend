I need lunch so, I'm writing my status for you to see

I started on a GraphQL + Postgres based backend.  I was not thinking clearly and this instance of code reflected this.  Last night I deleted it and started from scratch.

I now have:
GraphQL + MongoDB based backend.  I hope this does not bite me since MongoDB is not open source for business.  However, if this comes up, it is about a day to convert to another NoSQL open source db.  Plus, right now I can host this on Heroku (for free)

I have the following data structures (at the database)

Parent - holds info about a parent.  A parent can have many children
Child - a Child can have 1 or more parents
Host - a host can have many children staying with them at once.

I have the following API

getParents - produces a list of parents in the system
getParent - gets a single parent (by id)
createParent - creates 1 parent
updateParent - update

getChildren - list of all children 
getChild - one child
createChild - make one
updateChild - update

getHosts - get a list
getHost - get a single host
createHost - make one
updateHost - change / update

In testing right now...
addChildToHost - shows that a child is staying with a Host
removeChildFromHost - and delete the above relationship
addParentToChild - link child and parent
addChildToParent - link the other way

Host child relationships are transient, meaning they only last for a short while.

There is an admin API planned:
deleteParent
deleteChild
deleteHost

Future stuff:
There is a (real-time through the app) chat feature planned
There is also the idea of role and authentication (auth is only partial right now)
